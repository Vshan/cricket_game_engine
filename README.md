# Cricket Game Engine

A game engine simulating the sport of cricket. Also acts as a research project to mathematically determine an exhaustive list of factors affecting a player's performance.

The heart of the engine lies in the probability algorithms used in ```ball.rb ```.

Built on Ruby, using a completely object oriented approach.

Looking forward to porting it to Haskell, to try a purely functional approach :) 

## Usage ##

Fork the repo or download the files and then using the command prompt, run the ```game.rb``` file.

```ruby
$ ruby game.rb
```

Pick the teams and the number of overs. Rest should be fairly straightforward.

Have fun!
